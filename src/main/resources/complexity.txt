Big O -> worst time complexity
Big 0 -> average time complexity
Big ohm -> best time complexity

O(1) -> constant time
O(n) -> n times


Array:
        access : O(1)  : if you know position to access i.e. arr[pos]
        search : O(n)  : need to look every element to match, could be at nth pos
        insert : O(n)  : given input n numbers, all element will take n times
        delete : O(n)  : if first position will be deleted then all next element need to shift to left

Stack:
        access : O(n)  : we can't access any element element directly except top element
        search : O(n)  : same as above
        insert : O(1)  : insert in stack's top position directly
        delete : O(1)  : remove from top position directly
Queue:
        access : O(n)  : have not direct access to every element, access to head and tail only
        search : O(n)  : same as above
        insert : O(1)  : add to tail/rear
        delete : O(1)  : remove from front/head
Singly/Doubly Linked List:
        access : O(n)  : access to only head pointer, can't access to anyone directly
        search : O(n)  : access to only head pointer, need to traverse all one by one
        insert : O(1)  : inserting at head, point new element's next to head and return new element as head
        delete : O(1)  : deleting head, and return next element as head.

HashMap:
        search : N/A   : generally it's said O(1) for average case, but depends hash implementation
                         O(1) time to go to bucket, but in bucket to search takes O(logn) time
                         for particular element in case of java 8
                         worst case can go up to O(logn) -> might all elements in one bucket

        add    : N/A   : same as above
        delete : N/A   : same as above
Binary Search Tree:
        search : O(n),0(logn) : worst case, think all elements added was in asc/desc order, bst will be created in
                                vertical left/right line, So, access will be like single linked list.
                                but average it'll be log(n)
        insert : O(n),0(logn) : same as above
        delete : O(n),0(logn) : same as above

AVL tree and
Red Black tree : O(log) : for all operations for best and average case.

Heap:
       getMin -> O(1)
       add -> O(nlogn) for n element : log n for 1 element
       delete -> O(logn) for 1 element
       sort -> O(nlogn)


BFS: O(V+E) -> will visit each vertex when it's unexplored and enqueue
               each enqueue will take O(1)
               will visit each vertex when it's explored and dequeue it
               each dequeue will take O(1)

               similarly each edge will be visited once explored and unexplored.
               So, O(V+E)

DFS: O(V+E) -> will visit each vertex when it's unexplored and pushing to stack
                each push will take O(1)
                going in depth -> once visited will set as visited, so won't come
                again while exploring
                next time it'll come just checking explored or not explored
                O(1)
